# **ALX Listing App**

## Project Description

The **ALX Listing App** is a web application designed to create a listing page similar to Airbnb, where users can view property listings, filter them based on different criteria, and explore details about each property. The primary goal of this project is to showcase the ability to design a user-friendly interface and implement dynamic listing functionality.

## Project Structure

- **components/**: Contains all reusable UI components like buttons, cards, filters, and modal dialogs. These components are the building blocks of the listing page.
- **interfaces/**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for various data structures used throughout the app, such as Property, User, and Filter options. This ensures type safety across the app.
- **constants/**: Holds constant values like API URLs, filter options, and other fixed data used throughout the application.
- **public/assets/**: Stores static files such as images, icons, fonts, and other assets used in the UI.
